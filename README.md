### About me
Hi my name is Jonathan. I'm a webdeveloper from Esbjerg, Denmark. I started coding in 2018 in highscool as an elective. Since then i have taken an education as a multimedia designer. I'm currently studying to become webdeveloper and I'm gradutaing in January 2023. 

### My work
I have done various projects. My first ever projects was small prototypes in highscool with a Rasberry Pi. I then began developing for the web where i started with small basic webpages. 
For my final exam as a multimedia designer i developed an app for a scavenger quiz hunt. The participants of the scavenger hunt use the app to scan QR-codes. The QR code then gives access to a question they have to answer and then get awarded points. (https://fyrtoejet-eb6bc.web.app/)
