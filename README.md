### About me
Hi my name is Jonathan. I'm a webdeveloper from Esbjerg, Denmark. I started coding in 2018 in highscool as an elective. Since then i have taken an education as a multimedia designer. I'm currently studying to become webdeveloper and I'm gradutaing in January 2023. 

### My work
I have done various projects. My first ever projects was small prototypes in highscool with a Rasberry Pi. I then began developing for the web where i started with small basic webpages. 
For my final exam as a multimedia designer i developed a vue webapp for a scavenger quiz hunt. The participants of the scavenger hunt use the app to scan QR-codes. The QR code then gives access to a question they have to answer and then get awarded points. (Live website: https://fyrtoejet-eb6bc.web.app/ Github: https://github.com/jona737a/fyrtoejet-7-kanten)
For my first exam as a webdevelopment student i made a basic social media app. We made everything frombackend to frontend. The backend is a MySQL database and the website was made using PHP. (Live website: https://jancydesign.dk/ Github: https://github.com/ChristinaJancy/MusicPit)
